# Tailspin Toys Crowd Funding Development Guidelines

This is a crowdfunding platform for games with a developer theme. The application uses a Flask backend API with SQLAlchemy ORM for database interactions, and an Astro/Svelte frontend with Tailwind CSS for styling. Please follow these guidelines when contributing:

## Code standards

### Required Before Each Commit

- Run Python tests to ensure backend functionality
- For frontend changes, run builds in the client directory to verify build success and the end-to-end tests, to ensure everything works correctly
- When making API changes, update and run the corresponding tests to ensure everything works correctly
- When updating models, ensure database migrations are included if needed
- When adding new functionality, make sure you update the README
- Make sure all guidance in the Copilot Instructions file is updated with any relevant changes, including to project structure and scripts, and programming guidance

### Code formatting requirements

- When writing Python, you must use type hints for return values and function parameters.
- Every function should have docstrings or the language equivalent
- Before imports or any code, add a comment block that explains the purpose of the file.

### Python and Flask Patterns

- Use SQLAlchemy models for database interactions
- Use Flask blueprints for organizing routes
- Follow RESTful API design principles

### Svelte and Astro Patterns

- Use Svelte for interactive components
- Follow Svelte's reactive programming model
- Create reusable components when functionality is used in multiple places
- Use Astro for page routing and static content

### Styling

- Use Tailwind CSS classes for styling
- Maintain dark mode theme throughout the application
- Use rounded corners for UI elements
- Follow modern UI/UX principles with clean, accessible interfaces

### GitHub Actions workflows

- Follow good security practices
- Make sure to explicitly set the workflow permissions
- Add comments to document what tasks are being performed

## Scripts

- Several scripts exist in the `scripts` folder
- Use existing scripts to perform tasks rather than performing them manually
- Existing scripts:
    - `scripts/setup-env.sh`: Performs installation of all Python and Node dependencies
    - `scripts/run-server-tests.sh`: Calls setup-env, then runs all Python tests
    - `scripts/start-app.sh`: Calls setup-env, then starts both backend and frontend servers

  - `models/`: SQLAlchemy ORM models
  - `routes/`: API endpoints organized by resource
